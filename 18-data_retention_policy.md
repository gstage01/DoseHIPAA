# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Dose Health understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Dose Health is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Dose Health has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Dose Health Customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 State Medical Record Laws

* Current Dose Health Customers have data stored by Dose Health as a part of the Dose Health Service.
* Once a Customer ceases to be a Customer, as defined below, the following steps are
  1. Customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
  2. <mark>`If no response to notice in #1 above within 7 days, or if Customer responds they do not want to reinstate account, Customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Dose Health and/or to have Dose Health continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, Dose Health will work with Customer to determine storage costs.`</mark>
  3. If Customer downloads data or does not respond to notices from Dose Health within 30 days, Dose Health removed data from Dose Health systems and Customer is sent notice of removal of data.
